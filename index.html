                Hi, my name's David Hamilton. I love solving problems and making other people laugh. My hobbies include reading, movies, and video games. I've also recently picked up coding which has been super fun. It's refreshing to pick up something and feel like I'm making large steps up in quality and complexity. 
                <br>
                I greatly enjoy pushing myself and the thrill of solving problems is intoxicating. Working on the filding films project really showed me that. 
                <br>
                Group work is one of my favorite things. Having someone to bounce ideas off of is extremely helpful. Being flexible on work is also very nice, solving problems as they show up is also something I enjoy.
                <br>
                As for hobbies, I currently enjoy board games. Having friends over and socializing is where I'm happiest. My favorite boarad games are ones where you can form alliances, plot, and scheme. It adds a level of complexity that makes games replayable. Current favorite game is the Dune board game.
